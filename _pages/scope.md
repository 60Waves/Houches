## [Les Houches Schools of Physics:  Sept 2 - Sept 6, 2024](https://www.houches-school-physics.com/program/program-2024/physics-of-wave-turbulence-and-beyond-celebrating-the-60th-birthday-of-sergey-nazarenko-1346094.kjsp?RH=1696321972020)
The workshop aims to bring together experts in wave turbulence to present the state of the art in the field at the theoretical, numerical and experimental levels. The limits of wave turbulence will also be discussed, including but not limited to strong wave turbulence and singularity formation. 

The main themes will be:

- Mathematics of kinetic equations

- Observation of wave turbulence

- Beyond wave turbulence 

# Celebrating the 60th birthday of Sergey Nazarenko

The workshop will be an opportunity to celebrate the 60th birthday of [Sergey Nazarenko](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=EPW6UlQAAAAJ&hl=fr), whose work over the past 30 years has significantly contributed to the understanding and research dynamics in wave turbulence.
