It has long been proposed that small-scale oceanic dynamics results from
nonlinear processes involving internal gravity waves. The scales in
question are not resolved in oceanic models but are accounted for by
ad-hoc parameterizations. Physically modeling their turbulent dynamics
would therefore be a major lever for improving parameterizations in
climate models. In this context, a promising avenue is the wave
turbulence theory. Its implementation in the case of internal waves in
density stratified fluids has nevertheless proved complex and remains an
open problem. It is the subject of delicate questions concerning the
convergence of the so-called "collision integral" which drives the
dynamics in wave turbulence problems.

In this lecture, I will present two recent works, one theoretical and
one experimental, which both aim at identifying solutions to the
internal gravity wave turbulence problem.

On the theoretical side, we establish predictions for the energy spectra
of the weak internal-wave turbulence problem which agree with oceanic
observations. The key is the assumption that energy transfers are
dominated by a class of non-local resonant interactions, known as
*induced diffusion* triads.

On the experimental side, the regime of internal wave turbulence has
remained globally inaccessible. Most experiments up to now indeed
conducted to a discretization of the energy in frequency and wavenumber
associated to the emergence of eigenmodes of the fluid domain. This
feature prevents the flow from approaching the regime described by the
wave turbulence theory. In our work we identify an experimental mean
allowing to inhibit the discrete wave modes opening the way to the
laboratory observation of a canonical internal gravity wave turbulence.
