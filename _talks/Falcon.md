I will review experimental advances in wave turbulence on the surface of a fluid [1,2]. Then, by experimentally tuning the dispersion relation of surface waves, I will show how to generate a shock-wave regime exhibiting strong intermittency [3,4]. Finally, I will focus on Anderson localization of gravity waves, a disorder-induced multiple-scattering phenomenon, and show that nonlinearity enhances Anderson localization of hydrodynamics surface waves [5].
