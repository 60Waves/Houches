After recalling some unexpected results obtained in the context of discrete anharmonic chains (Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou systems), I will present some work in progress on wave interactions and turbulence in nonlinear optical mesh lattices. These lattice systems exhibit discretisation both in time and space, possess a versatile control of the (linear) dispersion relation of its normal modes, and can be easily probed in nonlinear optical setups.
