This lecture will explore the forefront of research in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), focusing on the universal scaling states that signify a fundamental aspect of wave turbulence. We examine stationary Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra for both direct and inverse directions, which is crucial in understanding energy and particle cascades within these quantum systems. A significant portion of the lecture will be dedicated to discussing self-similar evolving states, a concept that represents the dynamic and non-stationary nature of wave turbulence in BECs.
By integrating theoretical predictions with high-resolution numerical results, the lecture aims to shed light on the complex behaviors of wave turbulence. We will navigate through the intricacies of identifying and understanding universal scaling states and their implications for both theory and experiment in the field of quantum fluids.
