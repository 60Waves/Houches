Nowadays, using stereo-imaging techniques, it is possible to measure the sea-surface elevation both in time and space. Such measurements represent a perfect tool for establishing the validity of the Wave Turbulence Theory for ocean waves. In the talk I will present a data set measured from the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower place about 15 km from the coast of Venice and I will discuss the results in terms of the Wave Turbulence Theory.
