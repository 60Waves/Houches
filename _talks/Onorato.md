One-dimensional chains serve as a fundamental model in condensed matter physics, laying the foundation for significant advancements in nonlinear physics and complex systems. The pioneering efforts in this field date back to the 1950s at Los Alamos, with Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and Tsingou making notable contributions. Over the past 70 years, there has been extensive mathematical and physical research, and a recent perspective on the thermalization mechanisms in such systems has emerged through the Wave Turbulence approach. In this presentation, I will provide a critical overview of the outcomes achieved within this framework.
