In this talk I will give a brief review of experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates investigating the development of turbulent flows. I will discuss the different trap geometries and excitation methods and explain how wave turbulence can be evidenced in
time-of-flight pictures. Finally I will explain how vortex turbulence can be studied thanks to the development of new experiments and try to highlight a few future research directions.
